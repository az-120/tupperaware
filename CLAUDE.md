# TupperAware — Claude Code Spec

## Project overview

TupperAware is an iOS app (React Native + Expo) that tracks household food inventory
and expiration dates. Users belong to a household, which contains named locations
(fridge, pantry, freezer, etc.), each holding food items with expiry tracking and
push notification alerts.

Being built solo with Claude Code as an empirical case study in LLM-driven
development, compared against a 4-person 48-hour hackathon baseline.

## Data model

### Tables

```
households
  id          uuid PK
  name        text
  created_at  timestamp

household_members
  id             uuid PK
  household_id   uuid FK -> households.id
  user_id        uuid FK -> auth.users.id
  role           text ('owner' | 'member')
  joined_at      timestamp

locations
  id             uuid PK
  household_id   uuid FK -> households.id
  name           text  ('Fridge' | 'Pantry' | 'Freezer' | custom)
  icon           text  (emoji or icon key)
  created_at     timestamp

items
  id             uuid PK
  location_id    uuid FK -> locations.id
  name           text
  category       text  ('Dairy' | 'Produce' | 'Meat' | 'Frozen' | 'Pantry' | 'Other')
  quantity       text  (e.g. '1 gal', '12 ct')
  expiry_date    date
  barcode        text  (nullable)
  status         text  ('active' | 'used' | 'discarded')
  added_by       uuid FK -> auth.users.id
  created_at     timestamp
  updated_at     timestamp
```

### Key rules

- Items are fetched by `location_id`, sorted by `expiry_date` ASC
- "Expiring soon" = expiry_date within 3 days of today
- "Expired" = expiry_date < today
- Deleting a location soft-deletes its items (set status = 'discarded')
- RLS: users can only read/write data belonging to their household

## App screens & navigation

```
(tabs)
├── index          → Household home (location cards + expiry summary)
├── expiring       → All items expiring within 3 days, across all locations
├── search         → Search items by name across household
└── profile        → Account, household settings, notification prefs

(stack — launched from home)
├── location/[id]  → Location view (items list, filter: all/expiring/category)
├── item/[id]      → Item detail (metadata, freshness bar, mark used/discard)
└── item/add       → Add item (scan tab + manual tab, location selector)

(auth — shown when no session)
├── sign-in
└── create-account → then → create-household → app home
```

## Color palette (from mockups)

```ts
// constants/colors.ts
export const Colors = {
  blue: "#185FA5",
  blueBg: "#E6F1FB",
  green: "#3B6D11",
  greenBg: "#EAF3DE",
  amber: "#854F0B",
  amberBg: "#FAEEDA",
  red: "#A32D2D",
  redBg: "#FCEBEB",
  textPrimary: "#2C2C2A",
  textSecondary: "#5F5E5A",
  border: "#D3D1C7",
  surface: "#F1EFE8",
};
```

---

## Expiry logic

```ts
// Given an expiry_date string (YYYY-MM-DD), return status
export function getExpiryStatus(
  expiryDate: string,
): "expired" | "critical" | "warning" | "fresh" {
  const days = differenceInDays(parseISO(expiryDate), new Date());
  if (days < 0) return "expired";
  if (days <= 2) return "critical"; // red pill
  if (days <= 5) return "warning"; // amber pill
  return "fresh"; // green pill
}
```

## Environment variables

## Claude Code conventions

- Always use TypeScript. No `any` types.
- Prefer named exports over default exports for components.
- Hooks live in `/hooks`, pure utility functions in `/lib`.
- Never write inline styles longer than 2 properties — use StyleSheet.create.
- When adding a new screen, update the screen list in this file.
- After each completed feature, output a one-line git commit message suggestion.
- If a task requires a Supabase schema change, output the SQL migration first and wait for confirmation before writing app code.

---

## Testing & validation standards

### Testing framework

- Jest + React Native Testing Library
- Test files live in `__tests__/` folder at root level
- Test file naming: `[filename].test.ts` or `[filename].test.tsx`
- Run tests with: `npm test`

### What to test

- All utility functions in `lib/` — pure functions are highest priority
- Input validation logic
- Data transformation functions
- Hook logic where possible

### Testing requirement for new features

Every new feature task must include unit tests. Specifically:

- Any new utility function in `lib/` must have corresponding tests
  in `__tests__/`
- Any new validation logic must be tested
- Tests must be written in the same task as the feature, not after
- After writing tests always run `npm test` and fix any failures before considering the task complete
- CC must suggest test cases for UI logic even if they aren't formally written as unit tests

### Input validation rules

- Item name: required, min 2 chars, max 100 chars, no special chars
- Household name: required, min 2 chars, max 50 chars
- Email: standard email format validation
- Expiry date: must be a valid date, not more than 10 years in future
- Quantity: optional, max 20 chars
- All validation errors must show inline below the relevant input field
- Validate on submit AND on blur (when user leaves a field)

### Validation utility

- All validation logic lives in `lib/validation.ts`
- Exported as pure functions so they are easily testable
- Each function returns `{ valid: boolean, error: string | null }`

## Current task

Task 3 of 3: Add pick mode with checkbox item selection to the
recipes tab.

### 1. Update `lib/anthropic.ts`

Add a second exported function `fetchRecipesForSelectedItems`:

```typescript
export async function fetchRecipesForSelectedItems(
  selectedItems: Item[],
): Promise<Recipe[]>;
```

The function should:

- Build a prompt for specific item selection:

```text
You are a helpful cooking assistant. The user wants to cook
using these specific ingredients:
${selectedItems.map(i => - ${i.name} (expires in X days)).join('\n')}
Common pantry staples (salt, pepper, oil, basic spices) are
always available.
Rules:

Suggest exactly 3 recipes using ONLY the listed ingredients
plus pantry staples
Do not suggest recipes requiring unlisted ingredients
Respond ONLY with a valid JSON array, no markdown:
[{
"name": string,
"emoji": string,
"usesItems": string[],
"urgentItems": string[],
"description": string (2 sentences max),
"cookTime": string,
"difficulty": "Easy" | "Medium" | "Hard"
}]
```

- Same API call pattern as fetchRecipeSuggestions
- Return parsed Recipe[] or throw on error

### 2. Component: `components/SelectableItemRow.tsx`

A variant of ItemRow with a checkbox:

- Accepts item, selected (boolean), onToggle callback
- Checkbox on the left (use a simple square with checkmark
  rendered as styled View components, not a library)
- Item name, category, quantity as usual
- ExpiryPill on the right
- Tapping anywhere on the row toggles selection
- Selected state: checkbox filled with Colors.blue,
  row has subtle blue tinted background
- Unselected state: empty checkbox border, white background
- Uses Colors from constants/colors.ts

### 3. Update `app/(tabs)/recipes.tsx` — add pick mode

Replace the "Coming in next update" placeholder in the
"I'll choose" segment with the full pick mode:

Pick mode layout:

- Header row: "Select items to cook with" label on left,
  "X selected" count on right in blue
- Full scrollable list of ALL active household items
  sorted by expiry_date ASC using SelectableItemRow
- Items grouped into two sections:
  - "Expiring soon" section (≤5 days) shown first
  - "All items" section (6+ days) shown below
  - Section headers as muted uppercase labels
- No pre-selection — all items start unchecked
- Sticky bottom bar that appears when ≥2 items selected:
  - "Suggest recipes using X items →" button (blue)
  - Disabled and grayed out when < 2 items selected
- Loading and error states same as smart mode
- Recipe cards same component as smart mode
- Caching: fingerprint = selected item IDs sorted and joined
  Cache separately from smart mode recipes

### 4. Update `__tests__/anthropic.test.ts`

Add tests for fetchRecipesForSelectedItems:

- Mock fetch, verify correct prompt structure is sent
- Verify selected item names appear in prompt
- Test successful parse returns Recipe array
- Test error handling

### Notes

- Sticky bottom bar: use a View with position absolute at
  bottom of screen, not position fixed
  Add paddingBottom to ScrollView to prevent content hiding
  behind it
- Use StyleSheet.create for all styles
- After all files written run `npm test` and `npx tsc --noEmit`
  fix all errors before committing
- Suggest a git commit message when done
